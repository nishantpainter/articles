## Bit History

In a computer program, control flow is the order in which set instructions are executed. A control flow statement changes program flow, to achieve specific results, by choosing a path from available paths. These statements can be based on some condition; executing instructions only when some condition is met; or can be unconditional; arbitrarily transferring the flow to some different instruction set. The goto statement was the most basic form of unconditional transfer. It transfers the control to the labelled instructions set.

'GOTO LABEL;'
