## Bit History

In a computer program, control flow is the order in which set instructions are executed. A control flow statement changes program flow, to achieve specific results, by choosing a path from available paths. These statements can be based on some condition; executing instructions only when some condition is met; or can be unconditional; arbitrarily transferring the flow to some different instruction set. The goto statement was the most basic form of unconditional transfer. It transfers the control to the labelled instructions set.

'GOTO LABEL;'

Goto performs one-way transfer of control which means the control is not expected to return after executing the labelled instructions set. On the contrary, calling a [Function](functional-programming.md) usually returns the control after execution. In earlier programming, goto statements were used extensively. However, with increasing complexity it becomes harder to maintain computer programs because goto resulted in non-linear change of control flow which was harder to understand compared to linear transfer.
